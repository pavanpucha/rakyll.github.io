      <title>Debugging Go core dumps</title>
      <link>https://rakyll.org/coredumps/</link>

      <description>Debugging is highly useful to examine the execution flow and to understand the current state of a program. Debugging of core dumps is another diagnostics aid to debug the misbehavior of production services.
Why to debug core dumps?
 You may have running programs that has crashed unexpectedly, and you want to investigate why. There might be issues that are only reproducible during production time and you want to understand the state of a program while it is running in a specific environment.</description>

      <title>Automatic Stackdriver Tracing for gRPC</title>
      <link>https://rakyll.org/grpc-trace/</link>

      <description>In monolithic systems, it is relatively easy to collect diagnostic data from the building blocks of a program. All modules live within one process and share common resources to report logs and errors.
Once you are distributing your system into microservices, it becomes harder to follow a call starting from the user&amp;rsquo;s entry point until a response is served. To address this problem, Google invented Dapper to instrument and analyze its production services.</description>

      <title>Naming tests to self-document</title>
      <link>https://rakyll.org/naming-tests-to-doc/</link>

      <description>Go doesn&amp;rsquo;t specifically enforce you how you choose your test names. Tests are a significant contributors for the maintainability of your code. Tests not just providing correctness checking but also are useful in self documenting your code and its usage. On top of that, tests are the single best source to read about responsbilities of a type, function, etc. This is where naming tests better can help the internal documentation and therefore the maintainability of your code.</description>

      <title>Style guideline for Go packages</title>
      <link>https://rakyll.org/style-packages/</link>

      <description>Go is about naming and organization as much as everything else in the language. Well-organized Go code is easy to discover, use and read. Well-organized code is as critical as well designed APIs. The location, name, and the structure of your packages are the first elements your users see and interact with.
This document&amp;rsquo;s goal is to guide you with common good practices not to set rules. You will always need to use your own judgement to pick the most elegant solution for your specific case.</description>

      <description>Go 1.8 is going to to launched in February 2017. There is a sizable list of new features and improvements on the release notes. While these notes is the best summary to see what has happened in the last 6 months, I will try to give you some stats to give you a sense of the size of the work. I have examined all the changes merged into the tree during the Go 1.</description>

      <description>Go 1.8 introduces a new profile, the contended mutex profile, that allows you to capture a fraction of the stack traces of goroutines with contended mutexes.
You need to set the sampling fraction by calling runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction to a value above zero to enable collection.
Consider the following program:
import _ &amp;quot;net/http/pprof&amp;quot; var mu sync.Mutex var items = make(map[int]struct{}) runtime.SetMutexProfileFraction(5) for i := 0; i &amp;lt; 1000*1000; i++ { go func(i int) { mu.</description>

      <title>The default GOPATH</title>

      <guid>https://rakyll.org/default-gopath/</guid>
      <description>Go 1.8 will set a default GOPATH if the GOPATH env variable is not set.
The requirement of setting a GOPATH has been a major issue for Go users who installed the Go tools for the first time and got the &amp;ldquo;you have to set a GOPATH&amp;rdquo; error in their initial experience with the tools. Explaining the GOPATH is and instructing how to set this env variable were both distracting new users away from using Go.</description>

      <description>Go 1.8 is going to feature support for HTTP/2 server push.
HTTP/2 has many features designed to make the Web faster. One of those features is the server push, the ability to send resources before the client asks for it. This feature enables websites to push assets like JavaScript and CSS files before waiting for the web page to be loaded and asking for those resources.
net/http package will support server push by exposing a Pusher API that will be supported by HTTP/2 ResponseWriters.</description>

      <guid>https://rakyll.org/deprecated/</guid>
      <description>In Go, for a long time, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a convention to label the deprecated APIs. In the past years, there is new convention emerged to add deprecation notices to the docs.
Today, standard library uses this specific format.
As an example, Go 1.8 deprecates sql/driver.Execer and adds a deprecation notice to its godoc.
// Execer is an optional interface that may be implemented by a Conn. // // If a Conn does not implement Execer, the sql package&#39;s DB.</description>

      <title>Using contexts to avoid leaking goroutines</title>

      <description>The context package makes it possible to manage a chain of calls within the same call path by signaling context&amp;rsquo;s Done channel.
In this article, we will examine how to use the context package to avoid leaking goroutines.
Assume, you have a function that starts a goroutine internally. Once this function is called, the caller may not be able to terminate the goroutine started by the function.
// gen is a broken generator that will leak a goroutine.</description>

      <description>Last week, I was at dotGo, participating one of the finest Go conferences and catching up with gophers from the other side of the Atlantic. I gave a very short lightning talk about inspection of code generation with the tools alrady available in the toolchain. This post goes through the talk for those who didn&amp;rsquo;t have to priviledge to be at the conference. Slides are also available at go-talks.</description>

      <title>Keeping Go a human-first language</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: I forked my opinions on this one from a barely readable Twitter thread and wanted to write it down how I feel about keeping the language internals away from the users, especially from the newcomers. This is not a skill-level concern, it is a core goal of Go to provide a high-level programming language that saves users from excessive mental overhead. Note that these are personal opinons and are not writen on the behalf of a group.</description>

      <description>Go programming language provides many unique good features to write and maintain examples for your packages backed by the testing tools.
As an addition to the test coverage and test coverage report, go test also can provide coverage for testable examples.
Use the following commands in your package to use the -run flag to only the match the example tests and view the results in your browser.
$ go test -v -run=Example -coverprofile=c.</description>

      <description>With Go 1.7, testing package supports sub-tests that allows you to run multiple smaller tests from a test case. Each sub test is reported independently in the go test output. More information about these recent additions can be found at Marcel van Lohuizen&amp;rsquo;s recent talk from GolangUK 2016.
These additions to Go 1.7 enabled reporting and other testing.T functionality for subtests. One of the biggest contributions of the recent changes is to be able to use these features for table-driven tests.</description>

      <description>Apple has a suite of instrumentation and tracing tools for performance analysis avaiable as a part of their Xcode tooling set. In this article, we will use Instruments to record and analyze the CPU profile of a Go program.
Instruments also provide a large set of macOS-specific tracing and profiling if you have performance issues specifically on darwin.
Some of these specific profiles are:
 System trace: Collects comprehensive information about system calls, scheduling, user-kernel space transitions.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: This article is not about a core Go package or tool but gRPC.
gRPC provides support for implementing streaming endpoints as well as streaming support in their clients. Bidirectional streaming is useful if you want both server and client to be able to communicate to the other side independently in a full duplex fashion.
In this article, I will dig into how to use the streaming gRPC Go client to talk to a streaming API endpoint.</description>

      <description>I started this blog to fill the gaps in knowledge transmission and provide useful everyday tips about the Go programming language, its packages and tools.
About me I am an engineer working on the Go programming language. My current responsbility within the project is to look at things from a Go user&amp;rsquo;s perspective and make sure our work is aligned with overall requirements of the Go users. As a part of my daily job, I do design reviews, write code against the latest APIs, publish packages and tools to fill the gaps, run experimentations to propose the missing parts, and communicate our work and goals.</description>

      <title>Apply transformations to Go code with eg</title>

      <description>If you are willing to make large scale refactoring in your Go programs, automating the refactoring tasks is more desirable than manual editing. eg is a program that allows you to perform transformations based on template Go files.
To install the tool, run the following:
$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/eg  eg requires a template file to look for which transformation it should apply to your source code. What&amp;rsquo;s nice is that the template file is a Go file with little annotations.</description>

      <description>Note: Swift bindings are highly experimental and subject to change. This work must currently be classified as preliminary work and we will be improving APIs in the long term.
As a part of the Go Mobile, we have announced tools and packages that make language bindings from Java to Go and Objective-C to Go available. A relatively new and less documented aspect of the bindings is the availability of the Swift to Go calls.</description>

      <description>Note: This article extends Dave Cheney’s Go 1.5 cross compilers post.
Cross compilers got easier with Go 1.5. You don’t have to bootstrap the standard library and toolchain as you used to do prior to 1.5.
If cgo is not required The go tool won’t require any bootstrapping if cgo is not required. That allows you to target the following program to any GOOS/GOARCH without requiring you to do any additional work.</description>

      <title>Interface pollution in Go</title>

      <description>If there was a single powerful language feature in Go, it’d be the interfaces. The internals of Go contain strong combinations of useful ideas from various type systems and inevitably they ring the curiosity bells. I recently surveyed Github for Go interface declarations, and the results indicated that Go users pollute the environment with interfaces no one needs or will use.
Don’t export any interfaces until you have to.
Interfaces are great, but interface pollution is not so.</description>
