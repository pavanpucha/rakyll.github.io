      <description>Debugging is highly useful to examine the execution flow and to understand the current state of a program.
Core files is a file that contains the memory dump of a running process and its process status. It is primarily used for post-mortem debugging of a program, as well as to understand a program&amp;rsquo;s state while it is still running. These two cases make debugging of core dumps a good diagnostics aid to postmortem and analyze production services.</description>
