      <description>Go provides several pprof profiles out of thet box to gather profiling data from Go programs.
The builtin profiles provided by the runtime/pprof package:
 profile: CPU profile determines where a program spends its time while actively consuming CPU cycles (as opposed while sleeping or waiting for I/O). heap: Heap profile reports the currently live allocations; used to monitor current memory usage or check for memory leaks. threadcreate: Thread creation profile reports the sections of the program that lead the creation of new OS threads.</description>

      <description>Debugging is highly useful to examine the execution flow and to understand the current state of a program.
Core files is a file that contains the memory dump of a running process and its process status. It is primarily used for post-mortem debugging of a program, as well as to understand a program&amp;rsquo;s state while it is still running. These two cases make debugging of core dumps a good diagnostics aid to postmortem and analyze production services.</description>
